            <li>The purpose of this website is to read comments from a YouTube video, principally from the video series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24C8378F296DB656">Battle for Dream Island</a>, and to provide an estimate of the amount of users who indicate that they like or dislike characters for the purposes of entertainment and convenience by reducing the need to manually count comments.</li>
            <li>This website collects the following data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Comment data is retrieved from YouTube, consisting of user ID, comment ID, time the comment was last updated, and comment text content, for the purposes of reading "votes", character sequences typically in the form of a letter between two square brackets, and counting the votes recieved for a given letter. Your full comment text is not stored.</li>
                    <li>Your user ID and comment ID are stored for the purpose of only counting one vote per user. Your user ID and comment ID are not shared. </li>
                    <li>The time your comment was last updated is stored for the purpose of not counting votes published after the period in which votes are counted, typically 48 hours after the video is uploaded. This is not shared. </li>
                    <li>Total vote counts recieved for each letter are shared publicly on this website however there is no way to connect you personally to which letter you may have voted for through this website.</li>
                    <li>All data will be deleted shortly after the period in which votes are counted following a video's release, no longer than 28 days after collection.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I reserve the right to recollect data temporarily after the vote period finishes for the purpose of providing the service to YouTube for audit purposes.</li>
            <li>Although the YouTube Terms of Service designate your comment(s) as Content and provide other users with access to them, you may request the website not count comments connected to your YouTube channel by contacting the email at the end of the privacy policy, including a link to your YouTube channel. This request will be respected as soon as possible. Please note that this request does not affect your comments on YouTube and other parties are still able to collect that data. Of course if you wish that nobody can read your comments, then you should use a YouTube Application to delete the comment.</li>
            <li>This website only stores one piece of data on your device using localStorage technology which is used to track whether or not you have accepted this legal notice. This data is not transmitted to my server and is only kept on this device to ensure you have read the notice. If you do not wish for this website to store data on this device then decline the notice.</li>
